# Architecture

How things are organized, not how they look. Strong models write good code locally; what they
don't do by default is keep a whole codebase to **one home per fact**. This skill is that
discipline.

**Applied at planning.** The planner (`cortex-write-task`) loads this skill for dev work and
writes its decisions into the plan — which pattern each piece reuses, which contract comes first,
what goes in Shared Foundations. Executing agents follow the task; they consult this skill only
where the task names it.

**Project numbers live in project steering** — file-length limits, layer names, token names.
This skill gives the method and defaults.

## Before you build — answer in order, stop at the first "no"

1. **Is there a task for it?** Non-trivial work is planned in a task file first.
2. **Does a pattern already exist?** Search for it (UI component, request helper, action, test
   fixture). Extend it before creating one.
3. **Is the contract defined?** Data shapes and endpoints exist in the schema / spec first. Missing
   → change the contract, then build.
4. **Does an action already exist?** Anything a user or agent can do goes through the action layer.
5. **Does a decision already cover it?** Follow it, or plan a superseding decision.
6. **Will a second place need to know this?** If yes, it goes in a registry (§ Registries), not a
   local check.

## The rules

1. **Reuse: import, never paste; promote repeats.** Call existing code where it lives. Near fit:
   widen the shared code (every caller's tests stay green) or import it and add only the difference.
   A shape seen twice that means the same thing gets one home the rest import. A copy is a
   missing pattern. Copies are allowed only across a hard code boundary, held equal by a test.
2. **One job per file.** Default: aim for ~300 lines, functions ~50; the project's check fails
   past its limit. Split at a seam — move a cohesive unit (component, helper group, types) into
   its own file. Never squeeze: no joined lines, cut comments or shortened names.
3. **A split module keeps its public file.** `store/skills.ts` stays the one import; its parts
   live in `store/skills/`. Code outside the folder imports only the public file.
4. **One source per contract.** Every contract has exactly one source; everything else is
   generated from it or tested against it. See `references/contracts.md`.
5. **One layer per concern.** One request / I/O layer (only it calls APIs or touches files; it
   validates what it reads and writes). One action layer shared by people and agents. A button
   never calls an API directly.
6. **App-wide awareness goes through registries, never a local check.** Dependencies are edges in
   a references table; facts more than one place must know are rows in a conditions table. See
   `references/registries.md`.
7. **Mock the data, not the screens.** Fixtures in the exact contract shape; switching to real
   data is a setting, not a rebuild.
8. **UI structure is pattern-owned.** Each control in a plan names the component it reuses,
   decided at planning; no fit → ask the user. Style comes only from design tokens. Every state
   (idle, hover, focus, pressed, loading, success, error, disabled; data: loading, empty, error,
   partial, stale) belongs to the pattern, so a screen gets it by reuse. Accessibility is a gate.
9. **A bug fix starts with the failing test.**
10. **Prompts and agent instructions are code** — versioned, reviewed, and run against scenarios
    before they change.

## Planning outputs

When this skill shapes a plan, PLAN.md / task files record:
- the existing pattern or module each piece reuses (path + symbol);
- the contract change that comes first, and the tests that hold code to it;
- any new registry row (reference edge or condition) and who reads it;
- shared artifacts in TASK-STATUS.md Shared Foundations.

Docs that describe this code are held true by `cortex-docs`.
