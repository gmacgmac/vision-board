# Decision register

**How to read it.** An entry is *Proposed* or *Accepted*. Accepted entries are binding: when code
disagrees with one, the code is wrong. Proposed entries are open for review. **Today every entry is
Proposed**: they are carried over from Uplynk Studio's register and draft decisions
(`~/WORK/uplynk-studio/docs/decisions.md`, D-001 to D-011) and adapted, awaiting the
maintainer's review here. The reasoning is in [principles.md](principles.md).

**How to add to it.** Plan the decision as a Cortex task first. Then append the next number at
the end: date, status, the decision, why, the main alternative rejected, and the task link.
Never edit an Accepted entry; append a new one and mark the old one `Superseded by D-NNN`. The
work log (`cortex/LOG.md`) is not a decision record: it is pruned.

**Still open, not yet entries:** none. The framework (D-012) and the layout
engine (D-013) were decided on 2026-10-01; the component model is D-005, still Proposed.

## D-001 Plan before you build
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-008
- **Decision**: All work beyond a trivial fix starts as a plan and goes through a Cortex task.
  Decisions are recorded here, not in `cortex/LOG.md`.
- **Why**: The plan keeps the thinking, the task keeps what was done, so the project stays
  traceable. The log is pruned, so it cannot hold decisions.
- **Alternative rejected**: Unplanned coding with decisions left in chat history.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-002 Protected project instructions
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-007
- **Decision**: `.kiro/steering/vision-board-proj.md` is the one set of project rules; Kiro loads
  it, `CLAUDE.md` imports it, `AGENTS.md` points to it. It, `docs/principles.md`, this register
  and the design tokens change only with the maintainer's yes (GitHub `CODEOWNERS` once hosted).
- **Why**: Every person and agent follows the same rules, and no agent quietly rewrites them.
- **Alternative rejected**: Separate rule files per agent tool, which drift apart.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-003 One action layer
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-003
- **Decision**: Every board action is a typed action with inputs, a needs-human flag and a
  transcript record. Buttons, shortcuts and agents call the same actions; decisions on items
  are the person's.
- **Why**: One path means one place to check who may act and one complete record.
- **Alternative rejected**: Buttons writing files directly and a separate agent tool surface.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-004 The file formats are the contract
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-004, D-005 (adapted)
- **Decision**: The view file and transcript have versioned JSON Schemas in `packages/format/`;
  types, validator, fixtures and docs come from them. Fixture boards in the exact schema drive the
  gallery and tests.
- **Why**: The agent and the board agree on one machine-checked shape, and a fixture board and a
  live session run the same code.
- **Alternative rejected**: A loosely described format checked only by the UI.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-005 Components: core, template, element, page
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Accepted 2026-10-01 (refined by D-015) · **From**: Studio D-002, D-009 draft
- **Decision**: Each pattern has a framework-free core, one template for live and server render,
  and a plain web component; the framework only arranges pages. Anything shared is a web component.
- **Why**: Keeps the framework replaceable and makes patterns shareable with Studio. Studio's
  spike measured plain elements at 2.4 KB gzip against 16.9 KB (Svelte-compiled) and 29.7 KB
  (Vue-compiled).
- **Alternative rejected**: Framework-only components, unusable outside this app.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-006 Generated pattern index
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-006
- **Decision**: The pattern index, with states, is generated from each pattern's `pattern.json`,
  never written by hand.
- **Why**: A generated index is always true, so duplicated components get caught.
- **Alternative rejected**: A hand-maintained catalogue, which drifts.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-007 Dependency policy
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Proposed · **From**: Studio D-010 draft
- **Decision**: Build small things ourselves. Exact versions, install scripts off, every
  dependency in `docs/specification/dependencies.md`. npm workspaces. No lint framework: our own
  checks in `scripts/verify.mjs` plus Prettier; Node's built-in test runner.
- **Why**: Every package is code we run and review for years.
- **Alternative rejected**: ESLint, Vitest and pnpm: more to review for work our scripts do.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-008 Two contrast gates
- **Date**: 2026-09-30 · **Status**: Superseded by D-009 · **From**: Studio D-011 draft
- **Decision**: Every token pair passes WCAG 2 AA (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1) and APCA (text Lc 60, UI
  Lc 30) in light and dark; colours are `light-dark()` values. Needs Chrome/Edge 123, Firefox 120,
  Safari 17.5 or later.
- **Why**: APCA catches text that passes WCAG 2 yet reads poorly on dark.
- **Alternative rejected**: WCAG 2 alone.
- **Task**: none yet (founding set).

## D-009 APCA contrast in three tiers
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer ruling, 2026-10-01 (shared with sibling apps)
- **Decision**: Text contrast is APCA only, in three tiers, light and dark, measured with APCA-W3
  0.0.98G-4g: Lc 60 or more for reading text (body, muted, white on a button fill); Lc 45 or more
  for short coloured labels (links, headings, status words, inline code); Lc 30 or more for
  decoration (icons, focus rings, connectors). Body text (`--text`) carries no hue in any palette.
  A pair under its bar is reported, never shipped quietly. The maintainer may overrule a tier by
  eye; each overrule is recorded as a new decision. Supersedes D-008.
- **Why**: One Lc 60 bar for every pair proved too strict for short coloured labels in sibling
  apps, and WCAG 2 contrast passes saturated colours on dark that still read poorly.
- **Alternative rejected**: D-008, WCAG 2 AA plus a single APCA bar.
- **Task**: none (maintainer ruling in chat).

## D-010 The board talks to the agent through kiro-cli
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, first-look v2 item 25
- **Decision**: The board has one chat, in a panel on the right, powered by kiro-cli (`kiro-cli
  acp`) running on the maintainer's subscription. The agent updates the board through a tool call
  that writes a validated view. Its final text appears in the chat. The person's notes enter the
  chat input as chips that refer to nodes, and Send hands the round back. The board-launched agent
  gets the narrowest tool set that can write views. `vb wait` stays as the path for an agent
  already running in another session.
- **Why**: One conversation flows on the right while answers happen in context on the board. No
  copy-paste and no "go read it" step. Architect proved the shape with its side panel.
- **Alternative rejected**: the agent in the person's own chat session as the only driver, with
  the person pasting replies (vision.md v1, "Dropped: the app running Claude itself").
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]

## D-011 Containers are threads
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, first-look v2 items 20, 21
- **Decision**: Every node lives in a container (region), and a container is a thread of the
  conversation. The person can drag a container to move it, and drag items from one container to
  another, for example into the built-in Later container. Both moves are transcript records, so
  the agent's view still holds no coordinates. There is no freeform mode for now.
- **Why**: Containers give multi-threading and parking for free, and keep layout per container.
- **Alternative rejected**: a freeform mode with loose cards and no containers.
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]

## D-012 Plain Svelte for the app, SvelteKit later if needed
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, framework interview
- **Decision**: The board app is Svelte 5 built with Vite. No SvelteKit: our own Node server
  keeps serving the board's data and the kiro-cli connection. Add SvelteKit if a hosted version
  needs its routing, server routes or deployment adapters. The agent connection sits behind one
  module, so hosting it elsewhere swaps that module and nothing else.
- **Why**: Everything runs client-side plus one local server today, and Svelte components move
  into SvelteKit unchanged. Svelte matches Uplynk Studio.
- **Alternative rejected**: SvelteKit now, which brings routing and a server layer we don't use yet.
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]

## D-013 Our own canvas and layout engine, no node-graph library
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, framework interview
- **Decision**: We keep the hand-rolled canvas and layout engine and use no node-graph library
  (React Flow, Svelte Flow). A node type declares its outline (any shape: card, trapezoid,
  chevron, circle) and its ports (any number, on any side). The engine routes connectors to those
  ports and clips each line to the outline, and draws them in a layer beneath the nodes. Links stay
  a separate list in the view, because one link belongs to two nodes.
- **Why**: Full control of shapes, ports and layering with no framework to work around. The
  layout engine is the product's core. MIT-licensed libraries may still be read for techniques,
  with credit, but not copied wholesale.
- **Alternative rejected**: Svelte Flow (xyflow, MIT). It's capable, but the maintainer found
  its component model, port rules and layering confining in past projects.
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]

## D-014 First dependencies
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, framework interview
- **Decision**: svelte 5.57.1, vite 8.3.1, @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte 7.3.1, typescript 6.0.3,
  svelte-check 4.7.6. These are Uplynk Studio's exact versions. TypeScript stays on 6 because
  svelte-check 4.7.6 supports only 5 and 6. Exact pins, install scripts off, and each package is
  recorded in `docs/specification/dependencies.md` when it is installed. Browser page tests
  (Playwright, axe-core) need their own decision.
- **Why**: The smallest set for D-012. Same versions as Studio, so patterns move without
  friction.
- **Alternative rejected**: TypeScript 7.0.2, which svelte-check doesn't support yet.
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]

## D-015 One wrapper per pattern, driven by type definitions
- **Date**: 2026-10-01 · **Status**: Accepted · **From**: maintainer, framework interview
- **Decision**: Refines D-005, which follows Uplynk Studio's component model (framework-free core,
  template, plain web component; Svelte only arranges the app). Each pattern has one generic
  element: `<vb-node>`, `<vb-link>`, `<vb-region>`. A node type is a definition in one registry
  (outline, ports, fields, actions, state tokens), and the element renders whichever type it is
  given. A new type adds a definition, not a new element. A type that needs unusual content
  supplies only a body template.
- **Why**: An agent learns three patterns once. The same elements work in Studio, the Uplynk
  architecture repo or any framework.
- **Alternative rejected**: Svelte components draw the nodes (Option B), which would tie every
  shared pattern to Svelte.
- **Task**: [[cortex-tasks/board/2026-10-01_board-v3/PLAN.md]]
